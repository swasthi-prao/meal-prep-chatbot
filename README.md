# Meal Prep Chatbot

This project is a simple chatbot that helps users generate meal plans based on their preferences. The chatbot takes user input (like dietary restrictions, food preferences, etc.) and responds with a personalized meal plan. 

## Features

- **User Input**: Enter your meal preferences (e.g., vegetarian, high-protein, no dairy) and send it to the chatbot.
- **Meal Plan Generation**: The chatbot uses the provided information to generate a meal plan tailored to your needs.
- **Conversation History**: The chat history is displayed as you interact with the bot, showing both your inputs and the chatbot's responses.
- **Stop Feature**: Type "stop" to end the conversation and disable further inputs.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly, adapting to different screen sizes.

## How It Works

1. Enter your meal preferences in the text box.
2. Click "Send" to send your preferences to the chatbot.
3. The chatbot will generate a personalized meal plan and display it on the screen.
4. You can keep interacting with the chatbot until you type "stop" to end the conversation.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS for frontend design
- JavaScript for interactivity
- AWS Lambda for backend processing (meal plan generation)
